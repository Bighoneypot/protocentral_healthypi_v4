## Programming HealthyPi v4

### Programming with Arduino

![Arduino IDE](images/arduino_ide_new.png)

#### Setting up Arduino for ESP32

**Step 1: Download and Install the IDE**

The Arduino Software (IDE) allows you to write programs and upload them to your HealthyPiv4. Now you require Arduino Desktop IDE. You can download the latest version for Windows, Linux and Mac OS using the below link.
[Download the Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software#download)

**Note**: Once you have downloaded, install the IDE and ensure that you enable most (if not all) of the options, including the drivers. Click for installing instructions in [windows](https://www.arduino.cc/en/guide/windows), [linux](https://www.arduino.cc/en/guide/linux), [Mac OS](https://www.arduino.cc/en/guide/macOSX)

**Step 2: Get the HealthyPi v4 COM Port Number**

Next, you will need to connect the HealthyPi v4 board to a system. This is done via a USB connection. When the HealthyPi v4 is connected, the operating system should recognize the board as a generic COM port. The easiest way to do this is to type **Device manager** into Windows Search and select Device Manager when it shows.

In the Device Manager window, look for a device under Ports (COM & LPT) and chances are the Arduino will be the only device on the list.

**Step 3: Configure the IDE**

Now we have determined the COM port of the HealthyPiv4, its time to load the Arduino IDE and configure it to use the same device and port. You have to install the esp32 platform in the Arduino IDE to find an esp32 board in board manager. For installing esp32 platform follow up the link:

[Installing ESP32 Platform in Boards Manager](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/blob/master/docs/arduino-ide/boards_manager.md)

Ensure that in Arduino IDE, **File -> Preference -> Settings -> show verbose output during: -> compilation is enabled**

You can start by loading the IDE. When it is loaded, navigate to **Tools > Board > Esp32 dev module** and **Partition Scheme -> Minimal SPIFFS (1.9MB App with OTA/190Kb SPIFFS)**.

Next, you must tell the IDE which COM port the HealthyPi v4 is on. To do this, navigate to **Tools > Port > COMXX**. Obviously, if your HealthyPi v4 is on a different port, select that port instead.

In the Board Manager, **install ESP32 version 1.0.4**.



**Step 4: Installing Arduino ESP32 Filesystem(SPIFFS)**

An arduino plugin, Arduino ESP32 File system uploader needs to be installed for successful compiling of the Healthypi v4 firmware. [Refer this link](https://github.com/me-no-dev/arduino-esp32fs-plugin).

**Step 5: Uploading code to HealthyPi v4**

To enable easy installation of the Healthypi v4 firmware, [download the Protocentral HealthyPiv4 arduino library .zip](https://github.com/Protocentral/Protocentral_HealthyPiv4). Open Arduino IDE -> Sketch -> Include Library -> Add .ZIP library -> select the Healthypi-v4 .zip file. This ensures that the required libraries are installed.

#### * Excerpts from the code:

##### * Initializing the functionalities in HealthyPi v4
```c
void setup()
{
  Serial.begin(115200);

  if(Healthypi_Mode == WEBSERVER_MODE){
    Serial.println("Starts in webserver mode");
    HealthyPiV4_Webserver_Init();
  }

  else if(Healthypi_Mode == V3_MODE){
  Serial.println("Starts in v3 mode");
  }

  else{
  Serial.println("Starts in BLE mode");
  HealthyPiV4_BLE_Init();
  }

 }
```
##### * In the loop function below we read the vitals data from HealthyPi v4 .

```c
void loop()
{

  Heart Rate = (uint8_t) global_HeartRate;

  Respiration Rate = (uint8_t) global_RespirationRate;

  sp02 = (uint8_t)afe44xx_raw_data.spo2;

  temperature =  (uint16_t) tempSensor.getTemperature();

}
```  

**Step 6: Uploading SPIFFS data folder**

Navigate to **Tools->ESP32 Sketch Data Upload** and it will upload the SPIFFS File.

Note: Ensure that the data folder containing all of the SPIFFS
file is in the same folder as the ino file.

**Step 7: Compiling and Uploading**

Compile the code and check for compilation without error and upload the code to HealthyPi v4 and see the output in the mode of your choice.

### Programming with ESP IDF

![ESPidf](images/ESPidf.JPG)

In some cases where you need maximum performance, improved compatibility, and low overhead, you might want to use the native SDK. ESP-IDF is Espressif's official development SDK for the on-board ESP32-WROOM32 module. ESP-IDF also helps you understand what is happening under the hood. Through a simple step-by-step process to illustrate how to use ESP-IDF(Espressif IoT Development Framework).

#### What You Need?

To develop applications for ESP32 you need:
* PC loaded with either Windows, Linux or Mac operating system
* Toolchain to build the Application for ESP32
* ESP-IDF that essentially contains API for ESP32 and scripts to operate the Toolchain
* A text editor to write programs (Projects) in C

#### Preparation for development

There are three simple steps in the process of development:

* **Setup of Toolchain**
* **Getting of ESP-IDF from GitHub**
* **Installation and configuration**

**Step 1: Setting up the toolchain**

Windows don’t have a built-in “make” environment, so as well as installing the toolchain you will need a GNU-compatible environment. We can use the MSYS2 environment to provide this environment. The quick setup is to download the Windows all-in-one toolchain & MSYS2 zip file from dl.espressif.com: [Toolchain Setup- Windows](https://dl.espressif.com/dl/esp32_win32_msys2_environment_and_toolchain-20180110.zip)

The quick setup is to download the linux all-in-one toolchain from Espressif website:[Toolchain Setup 64-bit Linux](https://dl.espressif.com/dl/xtensa-esp32-elf-linux64-1.22.0-80-g6c4433a-5.2.0.tar.gz) and [Toolchain Setup 32-bit Linux](https://dl.espressif.com/dl/xtensa-esp32-elf-linux32-1.22.0-80-g6c4433a-5.2.0.tar.gz)

The quick setup is to download the ESP32 toolchain for macOS all-in-one toolchain from Espressif website:[Toolchain Setup macOS](https://dl.espressif.com/dl/xtensa-esp32-elf-osx-1.22.0-80-g6c4433a-5.2.0.tar.gz)


**Step 2: Getting ESP-IDF**

Besides the toolchain (that contains programs to compile and build the application), you also need ESP32 specific API / libraries. They are provided by Espressif in [ESP-IDF repository](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/get-started/index.html). To get it, open terminal, navigate to the directory you want to put ESP-IDF and clone it from espressif repository in github.


**Step 3: Setting up**

To set up the software environment and get esp-idf follow the instructions by clicking  [Windows](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/get-started/windows-setup.html), [Linux](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/get-started/linux-setup.html), [Mac OS](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/get-started/macos-setup.html).
