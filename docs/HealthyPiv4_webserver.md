#### Flow of OTA in HealthyPi v4

**1.** Perquisite for OTA update is the binary file of the latest firmware. The binary file is generated by Arduino IDE -> Sketch -> Export Compiled binary. The generated binary file is stored in the same folder as the .ino file.

**2.** Ensure the Healthypi v4 is in web server mode. The Soft AP mode and STA mode are the two modes in the web server.

**3.** On connecting the board via USB to the PC, the IP address of Healthypi v4 will appear on the Serial monitor while using Soft AP mode. Typing the IP address / MDNS (i.e., healthypi.local) in the web browser will direct to the  HealthyPi v4 web server dashboard.

**4.** In order to shift to the STA mode where the user can connect the Healthypi v4 to a private network, repeat the above step and click on the Change WiFi Network button on the dashboard, it redirects to the webpage for entering Network Credentials. The device restarts and automatically connects to the user's desired network and displays the IP address of the private network in the Serial monitor.
